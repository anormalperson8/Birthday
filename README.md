# Birthday Eevee

A Discord bot for storing birthdays, and announces when the date matches.<br/>
Written specifically for friends' Discord servers.

Also used as an exercise to familiarise myself with the syntax of Python programming language.

This project contains a lot of spaghetti codes.

## Version 2.1

#### Version 2.1.0
- Changed get_birthday so that whether a user's birth year is displayed depends on the `allow` 
attribute on their birthday entries.
- Changed all past users' entries' `allow` attribute to `false` (Except for itself).

#### Version 2.1.1
- Added the ability for the owner to add/delete server from the server data file.

#### Version 2.1.2
- The info command now has a cover page briefly introducing Eevee.

#### Version 2.1.3
- The `echo` and `echo2` commands now support new lines by manually typing `\n` in the message box.

#### Version 2.1.4
- Fixed a bug where the number of days until next birthday is calculated incorrectly.

## Version 2.0
Just like the first version, the bot is based mostly on slash commands.

The bot has been updated to accommodate multiple servers!

This bot remembers birthdays of users in a Discord server, and announces them on the relevant day.


#### Version 2.0.0
- Added support to multiple servers.
- Tried (Keyword: Tried) to make the code a little bit nicer to read. Just a *tiny little bit*. Still very spaghetti.

#### Version 2.0.1
- The `echo` text command has been updated!
- The `echo` text command has now been split into `echo` and `echo2`.
- The only difference is if the message is replying another one, `echo` pings the author while `echo2` does not.

#### Version 2.0.2
- Owner can now modify server information.
- The code is now slightly more readable. (It is still far from actually readable)
